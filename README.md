# Hotel Staff Scheduling System

## Description  
The **Hotel Staff Scheduling System** is a Java-based mini project designed to automate staff management and shift scheduling in hotels.  
It efficiently integrates essential Java concepts — **OOP, Exception Handling, Multithreading, JDBC, and GUI Design** — into a single cohesive system.  

This project allows administrators to **register staff, assign shifts, view schedules, and monitor tasks dynamically** using multithreading.  
The system ensures smooth execution through robust exception handling and file logging, while **Java Swing** provides an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface.  
Database connectivity using **JDBC with MySQL** enables secure and consistent data storage for staff information, shift timings, and task records.  

By combining frontend interactivity with backend reliability, the project demonstrates a practical implementation of core Java programming principles for real-world hotel management.
